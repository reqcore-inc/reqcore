# Topical Authority Map: Open Source ATS

> **Status:** Living roadmap — check off articles as they are published.
>
> **Goal:** Build definitive topical authority for "open source applicant tracking systems" across 9 tightly-linked content clusters.
>
> **Total articles:** 132 | **Target pace:** ~1 per day | **Timeline:** ~4 months (Phases 1–4) + ongoing refresh

---

## How This Map Works

### Design Principles
- **Tight `siteFocusScore`** — every article reinforces the core topic (open-source ATS, recruitment technology, self-hosted hiring software).
- **Minimal `siteRadius`** — no generic HR, career advice, or resume-tip content. Everything serves the topical graph.
- **Deep cluster coverage** — each cluster has one comprehensive pillar + focused supporting articles.
- **Strong internal linking** — every supporting article links to its pillar + 2–3 siblings. Cross-cluster links are noted explicitly.

### Exclusions
Generic HR content, general career advice, resume tips for job seekers. These dilute focus and attract unqualified traffic.

### Intent Tags
| Tag | Meaning | Typical Format |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| 🔵 | Informational | Guide, explainer, glossary |
| 🟢 | Commercial | Comparison, roundup, buyer's guide |
| 🔴 | Transactional | Checklist, migration tool, scorecard |

### Linking Rules
- Every supporting article **must** link to its cluster pillar.
- Every pillar **must** link to all its supporting articles.
- Cross-cluster links are noted with `→ [Cluster X]` and must be implemented as internal links.
- Follow the internal linking rules in [`.agents/skills/seo-skill/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/seo-skill/SKILL.md) §9.

### Content Quality Standards
All articles must follow the SEO Skill ([`.agents/skills/seo-skill/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/seo-skill/SKILL.md)):
- **Pillars:** 2,500+ words, hub page with links to every supporting article.
- **Supporting articles:** 1,200–2,000 words, links to pillar + 2–3 siblings.
- Every article must include at least one of: original screenshot, data point, code snippet, decision framework, or template.
- No filler paragraphs — every section teaches something specific.
- First-person experience from building Reqcore wherever relevant (E-E-A-T).
- Answer the query in the first 100 words (featured snippet + AI Overview optimization).
- Apply the full [SEO Quality Checklist](.agents/skills/seo-skill/SKILL.md) §15 before publishing.
- Update every pillar page quarterly (freshness signal).

### File Conventions
- Blog articles go in `content/blog/<slug>.md`
- Filename = URL slug (no dates, no uppercase, hyphens only) — see SEO Skill §5
- Complete frontmatter required (title, description, date, author, image, tags) — see SEO Skill §2
