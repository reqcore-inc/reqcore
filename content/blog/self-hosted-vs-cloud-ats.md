# Self-Hosted vs Cloud ATS: Cost, Control, and Data Ownership

A self-hosted ATS runs on infrastructure you control — your own server, VPS, or private cloud — while a cloud ATS is managed entirely by the vendor on their servers. The choice between them determines who owns your candidate data, what you pay per recruiter, and how much control you have over your hiring workflow.

Most companies default to cloud ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, or Workable without running the numbers. That default costs a 10-person hiring team $36,000+ over three years in subscription fees alone. A self-hosted alternative like [Reqcore](/) eliminates per-seat pricing entirely and keeps candidate data on your PostgreSQL database — not locked behind a vendor subscription.

This comparison breaks down the real trade-offs so you can make a decision based on cost, technical capacity, and data ownership priorities.

## What "Self-Hosted" and "Cloud" Mean for an ATS

A **cloud ATS** is software-as-a-service. You sign up, the vendor provides the application, database, and infrastructure. You pay a subscription — typically $50–$150 per recruiter per month — and access the system through your browser. Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, Ashby, JazzHR, and BreezyHR all follow this model.

A **self-hosted ATS** is software you install on your own infrastructure. You provision a server (a $10/month VPS or a managed platform like [Railway](https://railway.com/)), deploy the application, and connect your own database. The software is yours to run, modify, and control. [Reqcore](/) and [OpenCATS](https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS) are open-source examples. For a full comparison of available options, see our guide to the [best open source applicant tracking systems](/blog/best-open-source-applicant-tracking-systems).

The distinction matters because it determines three things: who holds your candidate data, what happens to your system when you stop paying, and whether your software bill grows every time you add a team member.

## Cloud ATS: Advantages and Drawbacks

### What cloud ATS does well

- **Zero infrastructure work.** No servers to configure, no databases to back up, no TLS certificates to renew. The vendor handles uptime, security patches, and scaling.
- **Fast onboarding.** Sign up and post your first job within hours. No deployment, no DNS configuration, no Docker.
- **Automatic updates.** New features ship to your account without any action on your part.
- **Vendor support.** Dedicated support teams troubleshoot issues. Enterprise tiers include dedicated account managers.

### Where cloud ATS falls short

**Per-seat pricing compounds fast.** According to [Gartner's HR technology research](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/hr-technology-strategy), companies spend an increasing share of HR budgets on SaaS subscriptions that scale with headcount rather than usage. A mid-tier cloud ATS at $100/seat/month costs $12,000/year for 10 recruiters — and every new hire to the hiring team adds $1,200/year to the bill.

**Your data lives on someone else's servers.** Candidate names, email addresses, phone numbers, resumes, interview notes, and pipeline history are stored on infrastructure you do not control. If you cancel your subscription, exporting that data is often incomplete. Custom fields, pipeline stages, and interview scorecards rarely survive a migration intact.

**Vendor lock-in is structural, not accidental.** Cloud ATS platforms benefit from making migration painful. Proprietary data formats, unique pipeline configurations, and ecosystem-specific integrations create switching costs that grow every month you use the product.

**AI decisions are opaque.** Many cloud ATS platforms now use AI to screen or rank candidates, but the scoring logic is hidden. The [EU AI Act classifies employment-decision AI as high-risk](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), requiring transparency and human oversight — requirements that black-box algorithms cannot meet. You cannot audit why a candidate was filtered out or ranked lower.

**Customization is paywalled.** Custom scoring models, non-standard pipeline stages, and integrations with internal tools require enterprise tiers that cost 2–5× the standard plans.

## Self-Hosted ATS: Advantages and Drawbacks

### What self-hosted ATS does well

**Full data ownership.** Your candidate database lives in your PostgreSQL instance, backed up on your schedule, retained as long as you decide. No vendor can hold your talent pool hostage behind a subscription.

When we built Reqcore, we chose PostgreSQL 16 specifically because it supports JSON columns for custom application form schemas and has the strongest data export tooling of any relational database. Candidate data is portable from day one — `pg_dump` gives you a complete, standards-compliant backup that works with any PostgreSQL-compatible tool.

**No per-seat fees.** Self-hosted software has no per-user pricing. Your entire hiring team — recruiters, hiring managers, coordinators — accesses the system without increasing costs. This eliminates the "growth tax" that punishes companies for scaling their teams.

**Privacy sovereignty.** Candidate PII never leaves your network. For companies in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government) or regions with strict data protection laws ([GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/), [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)), self-hosting removes an entire category of compliance risk. There is no third-party data processor to vet, no cross-border data transfer to justify.

**Transparent AI.** Open-source ATS platforms let you inspect the code behind every ranking decision. Reqcore's AI scoring shows a visible Matching Logic summary — recruiters see exactly why a candidate scored the way they did and can verify or override the result. This is the opposite of the "secret algorithm" approach used by commercial platforms.

**Full customization.** You control the source code. Need a custom pipeline stage, a proprietary scoring algorithm, or an integration with an internal HRIS? Fork the repo and build it. No enterprise tier required, no feature request queue.

### Where self-hosted ATS requires effort

**You manage the infrastructure.** Someone on your team needs to handle deployment, updates, backups, and monitoring. For a modern Docker-based application on a single VPS, this takes roughly 1–2 hours per month — but it is not zero effort.

**Initial setup takes hours, not minutes.** Provisioning a server, configuring DNS, setting up TLS, and deploying the application takes 4–8 hours for a first-time setup. Managed platforms like Railway reduce this to under 30 minutes.

**Updates are your responsibility.** You pull new releases and deploy them. Most modern self-hosted applications make this a single command (`git pull && docker compose up -d`), but the responsibility is yours.

**No vendor support hotline.** You rely on documentation, community forums, and your own team. Open-source projects with active communities mitigate this — Reqcore's codebase is MIT-licensed and the [product roadmap](/roadmap) is fully public.

## The Real Cost: 3-Year TCO Comparison

Most "self-hosted is cheaper" claims omit maintenance costs. Here is an honest total cost of ownership breakdown for a company with 10 recruiters over three years:

| Cost Item | Cloud ATS (Mid-Tier) | Self-Hosted (VPS) | Self-Hosted (Managed — Railway) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Software license** | $100/seat/mo × 10 = $12,000/yr | $0 (open-source) | $0 (open-source) |
| **Infrastructure** | Included | ~$15/mo VPS = $180/yr | ~$5/mo = $60/yr |
| **Initial setup** (at $150/hr) | 4 hrs = $600 | 8 hrs = $1,200 | 2 hrs = $300 |
| **Ongoing maintenance** (at $150/hr) | Included | 2 hrs/mo = $3,600/yr | 0.5 hrs/mo = $900/yr |
| **3-year total** | **$36,600** | **$12,540** | **$3,180** |
| **Cost per additional recruiter** | +$1,200/yr | $0 | $0 |
| **Data ownership** | Vendor-controlled | You own it | You own it |

The self-hosted VPS option costs **66% less** even after accounting for engineering time. The managed deployment on Railway — where infrastructure is handled for you — costs **91% less** than a mid-tier cloud ATS.

For a full breakdown of hidden ATS costs, multi-scenario modeling across different team sizes, and a TCO calculator framework, see our [total cost of ownership: SaaS ATS vs self-hosted](/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-saas-ats-vs-self-hosted) guide.

The savings multiply as you grow. Adding a 15th recruiter to a cloud ATS costs an extra $6,000 over three years. Adding that same recruiter to a self-hosted system costs nothing.

According to [SHRM research](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition), the average cost-per-hire is approximately $4,700. At $12,000/year in ATS subscription fees, you are paying the equivalent of 2.5 hires per year just for the software to manage the process.

## Five Questions to Decide Between Self-Hosted and Cloud

Use this framework to determine which model fits your organization. Answer each question, then check the recommendation.

### 1. Does your team include someone who can manage a Linux server or Docker deployment?

| Answer | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Yes** — A developer or DevOps engineer is on staff | Self-hosted (VPS or managed) |
| **Partially** — Someone technical but not a server admin | Self-hosted on a managed platform (Railway, Render) |
| **No** — Zero technical capacity on the team | Cloud ATS or managed self-hosted with contractor support |

### 2. How many people will use the ATS in the next 12 months?

Per-seat pricing becomes painful above 5 users. If you plan to give access to hiring managers, coordinators, and interviewers beyond just your core recruiting team, a self-hosted ATS avoids the compounding cost.

### 3. Do you handle sensitive candidate data or operate under privacy regulations?

Companies subject to [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/), [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa), HIPAA, or SOX face compliance overhead when candidate PII is stored on third-party infrastructure. Self-hosting eliminates the data processor relationship and keeps PII on infrastructure you audit and control.

### 4. Is your candidate database a long-term strategic asset?

If you are building a talent pool you intend to query and nurture over years — not just filling open roles — your candidate data is an asset, not a byproduct. On a cloud ATS, that asset is locked behind a subscription. Self-hosting makes it a permanent, portable resource.

### 5. Do you care how AI scores your candidates?

The [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) now classifies AI used in employment decisions as high-risk, requiring transparency and human oversight. If your ATS uses AI to filter or rank candidates, you should be able to explain every decision. Cloud ATS platforms do not allow this. Open-source self-hosted platforms do.

| Your Profile | Recommended Model |
|---|---|
| Technical team, 5+ ATS users, privacy-regulated | **Self-hosted (VPS)** |
| Technical team, cost-conscious, growing fast | **Self-hosted (managed — Railway)** |
| Non-technical, <5 people, short-term hiring | **Cloud ATS** |
| Non-technical, long-term hiring, budget-conscious | **Managed self-hosted + contractor** |

## How to Migrate from Cloud to Self-Hosted ATS

Switching from a cloud ATS to a self-hosted system is a one-time project, not an ongoing burden. Here is the process:

1. **Export your data.** Most cloud ATS platforms offer CSV exports for candidates, applications, jobs, and interview notes. Request the export before canceling your subscription — some vendors restrict access after cancellation.

2. **Deploy the self-hosted ATS.** For Reqcore, clone the repository and run `docker compose up`. This starts PostgreSQL, MinIO (S3-compatible document storage), and the application. Configure your domain and TLS. Total time: 30 minutes to 4 hours depending on your infrastructure choice.

3. **Map and import your data.** Align exported CSV columns to the new database schema. Reqcore uses PostgreSQL — write a migration script or use the API to import candidates, jobs, and applications programmatically.

4. **Verify imported data.** Spot-check 20–30 records across candidates, applications, and documents. Run through a complete hiring workflow (post a job, receive an application, move a candidate through the pipeline) to confirm everything works end-to-end.

5. **Update your job postings.** Point your careers page to the new system. Update links on job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn) to reference your new application URLs.

6. **Decommission the old system.** Cancel your cloud ATS subscription. Keep a final CSV export as a backup alongside your new PostgreSQL database.

The entire migration typically takes 1–3 days for a small-to-medium team. The result: a system you own, running on infrastructure you control, with zero recurring per-seat fees.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a self-hosted ATS?

A self-hosted applicant tracking system is recruitment software you install and run on your own infrastructure — a VPS, private cloud, or managed platform. You control the database, the application, and all candidate data. Open-source examples include [Reqcore](/) and OpenCATS.

### Is self-hosted ATS cheaper than cloud ATS?

Yes, substantially. A self-hosted open-source ATS eliminates software license fees entirely. Even after accounting for infrastructure ($5–$15/month) and maintenance time (1–2 hours/month), the 3-year cost is 66–91% lower than a mid-tier cloud ATS. The savings increase with each additional user, since self-hosted has no per-seat pricing.

### Is a self-hosted ATS secure enough for candidate data?

Self-hosted is not inherently less secure than cloud. Code transparency in open-source software — validated by [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) and supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/) — means vulnerabilities are identified and patched faster. The key security factors are deployment practices: use HTTPS, restrict database access, keep dependencies updated, and follow standard server hardening.

### Can a non-technical team use a self-hosted ATS?

Yes, through managed deployment platforms. Reqcore can be deployed on [Railway](https://railway.com/) with a GitHub push — no server administration required. You get the benefits of self-hosting (data ownership, no per-seat fees) without managing infrastructure directly.

### How long does it take to migrate from a cloud ATS to self-hosted?

A typical migration takes 1–3 days for a small-to-medium team. The steps are: export your data from the cloud ATS, deploy the self-hosted system, import and verify the data, and update your job board links. Most cloud ATS platforms support CSV exports, and self-hosted systems accept data via API or database import.

## The Bottom Line

Cloud ATS platforms trade control for convenience — and charge a steep, growing price for that trade. Per-seat pricing punishes team growth, vendor lock-in compounds over time, and candidate data remains on infrastructure you do not own.

Self-hosted open-source alternatives cost 66–91% less over three years, give you permanent ownership of your candidate database, and let you inspect every line of code — including AI scoring logic. The setup cost is real but one-time: a few hours with Docker, or 30 minutes on a managed platform.

If your ATS bill grows every time you add a recruiter, if you want to own your talent data as a long-term asset, or if the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) has you questioning black-box candidate scoring — self-hosted is no longer the difficult option. It is the rational one.
