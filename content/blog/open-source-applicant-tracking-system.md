# What Is an Open Source Applicant Tracking System?

An open source applicant tracking system (ATS) is recruitment software whose source code is publicly available under a recognized license — MIT, GPL, Apache, or similar. Anyone can download, run, modify, and redistribute it without paying licensing fees. Unlike proprietary ATS platforms from Greenhouse, Lever, or Workable, an open source ATS gives your team full visibility into how the software works and full ownership of the candidate data it stores.

If you manage hiring and want to understand what sets open source ATS apart from commercial alternatives — in cost, control, and capability — this guide covers it end to end.

## How an Applicant Tracking System Works

An applicant tracking system manages the hiring lifecycle from job requisition to offer letter. For a detailed breakdown of each stage — from resume parsing to AI scoring to data flow — see our guide on [how applicant tracking systems work](/blog/how-applicant-tracking-systems-work). At its core, every ATS performs five functions:

1. **Job posting** — Create job listings and distribute them to career pages and job boards ([Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Google for Jobs](https://jobs.google.com/)).
2. **Application collection** — Accept candidate applications via web forms, email, or API integrations. Store resumes, cover letters, and custom field responses.
3. **Pipeline management** — Track each candidate through configurable stages: applied → screened → interviewed → offered → hired (or rejected at any stage). When we built Reqcore's pipeline system, we learned that rigid 5-stage pipelines break immediately in practice — every team structures hiring differently. Configurable stages are not a nice-to-have, they are a core requirement.
4. **Collaboration** — Let recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers share notes, schedule interviews, and score candidates within a single system.
5. **Reporting** — Measure time-to-fill, source-of-hire, pipeline conversion rates, and other recruiting metrics that tell you where your process works and where it leaks.

The difference between open source and proprietary ATS is not *what* they do — it is *how they do it* and *who controls the system*. A proprietary ATS runs on the vendor's servers, hides its code, and charges per seat. An open source ATS runs on infrastructure you choose, publishes its code for inspection, and costs nothing to license.

## What "Open Source" Actually Means for ATS Software

"Open source" is a specific legal and technical designation — not a marketing label. Software qualifies as open source when it meets the criteria defined by the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org/osd):

- **Source code is publicly available.** Anyone can read, audit, and learn from it.
- **Free redistribution.** You can share the software without paying royalties.
- **Derived works allowed.** You can modify the code and distribute your modified version.
- **No discrimination.** The license cannot restrict who uses the software or for what purpose.

### Common Open Source Licenses in ATS Software

Different licenses impose different rules on how you can use and modify the software:

| License | Permissions | Conditions | ATS Examples |
|---------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **MIT** | Use, modify, distribute, commercial use | Include copyright notice | [Reqcore](/) |
| **GPL v3** | Use, modify, distribute | Modified versions must also be GPL (copyleft) | Various community projects |
| **MPL 2.0** | Use, modify, distribute | Modified files must stay MPL; can combine with proprietary code | OpenCATS |
| **Apache 2.0** | Use, modify, distribute, patent grant | Include notice, state changes | Various HR tech projects |
| **AGPL v3** | Same as GPL + network use triggers copyleft | If you run it as a web service, you must share source | — |

**Why this matters for your hiring team:** The license determines whether you can modify the ATS for internal needs without publishing your changes (MIT, Apache — yes; GPL, AGPL — depends). If you plan to customize heavily — adding proprietary scoring algorithms, internal HRIS integrations, or industry-specific workflows — choose a permissive license like MIT or Apache 2.0.

When we chose MIT for [Reqcore](/), the reasoning was straightforward: organizations evaluating an ATS should not need a lawyer to determine if they can integrate it with their existing systems. MIT imposes the fewest restrictions while still protecting the original authors.

### "Open Source" vs "Free" — They Are Not the Same

A critical distinction that most ATS comparison articles ignore: "free" software and "open source" software are different categories. For a comprehensive breakdown of each model — with a decision framework and real cost data — read our guide on [why open source and free ATS aren't the same thing](/blog/open-source-vs-free-ats).

- **Free (as in cost):** Many proprietary ATS platforms offer free tiers — BreezyHR, Zoho Recruit, and Freshteam all have $0 plans. But the source code is closed. You cannot inspect it, modify it, or self-host it. The vendor controls the product roadmap, your data, and the pricing of the features you will eventually need.
- **Open source (as in freedom):** The software is yours to run, read, modify, and distribute. Even if you pay for managed hosting or commercial support, the core code remains accessible. You can fork the project and continue independently if the original maintainers disappear.

Some software is both free and open source (Reqcore, OpenCATS). Some is free but not open source (BreezyHR free tier). Some is open source but not free to use at scale (open-core models with proprietary enterprise features). Understanding this spectrum prevents expensive vendor lock-in decisions disguised as "free trials."

## Key Features of an Open Source ATS

Every production-ready open source ATS should provide these capabilities. If a platform calls itself an ATS but lacks any of these, it is either a prototype or a CRM with a misleading label.

### Must-Have Features

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Job management** | Create, edit, publish, and archive job listings | The foundation — without this, it is not an ATS |
| **Candidate pipeline** | Visual or list-based tracking through hiring stages | Prevents candidates from falling through cracks |
| **Resume storage** | Upload and associate documents with candidate profiles | Legal record-keeping and reference during evaluation |
| **Application forms** | Configurable forms for candidate self-service applications | Reduces manual data entry, improves candidate experience |
| **Search and filter** | Find candidates by skills, status, job, or custom criteria | Essential once your database exceeds 100 candidates |
| **User roles and permissions** | Control who sees what — recruiters vs hiring managers vs admins | Data security and workflow clarity |
| **Email integration** | Send and track communications within the ATS | Eliminates context-switching between ATS and email client |

### Features That Differentiate Modern Open Source ATS

Beyond the essentials, newer open source ATS platforms add capabilities that were previously exclusive to enterprise SaaS:

- **AI candidate scoring** — Match candidates against job requirements automatically. The critical difference in open source: the scoring logic is visible. In [Reqcore](/), AI matching produces a readable summary explaining *why* a candidate scored the way they did — a transparency obligation the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) imposes on high-risk AI systems, which includes employment decisions. Proprietary platforms hide this logic behind opaque algorithms.
- **API access** — Programmatic access to jobs, candidates, and applications. Enables integrations with HRIS, payroll, background check tools, Slack, and calendar systems without waiting for the vendor to build a connector.
- **Custom fields and workflows** — Adapt the system to your process, not the other way around. Add industry-specific fields (security clearance level, certification status, shift preferences) without requesting a feature from a vendor.
- **Self-hosted document storage** — Resumes and attachments stored on infrastructure you control (MinIO, S3-compatible storage) rather than the vendor's cloud.

## Who Should Use an Open Source ATS?

Open source ATS is not for everyone. Here is who benefits most — and who should look elsewhere. For a deeper breakdown by company size and industry, see our [guide to open source ATS use cases](/blog/who-uses-open-source-ats).

### Strong Fit

| Profile | Why Open Source Works |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Startups (1–50 employees)** | Zero licensing cost. Deploy on a $5/month VPS or managed platform. Don't pay $12,000/year for 10 seats before you've made your first hire. |
| **Companies with developers on staff** | Customizing and maintaining the system is straightforward for teams with technical capacity. |
| **Privacy-regulated industries** | Healthcare, finance, government, and EU-based companies benefit from self-hosted candidate data that never touches third-party servers. No data processor agreements needed. |
| **Recruiting agencies** | Agencies adding recruiters pay per-seat with commercial ATS. Open source eliminates this cost entirely — hire 20 recruiters and the software bill stays at $0. |
| **Organizations building long-term talent pools** | Your candidate database is a strategic asset. On a proprietary ATS, it is a rental. On a self-hosted open source ATS, it is portable, permanent, and fully owned. |

### Weak Fit

| Profile | Why Open Source May Not Work |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Non-technical teams with no IT budget** | Self-hosting requires initial setup. Managed platforms (Railway, Render) reduce the burden but don't eliminate it entirely. |
| **Enterprise companies needing vendor support SLAs** | Open source communities provide support, but not contractual SLAs with guaranteed response times. Some open source projects offer paid enterprise support — check before ruling it out. |
| **Teams that need deep integrations on day one** | Proprietary ATS platforms often ship with 50+ pre-built integrations. Open source platforms typically offer API access but fewer turnkey connectors. |

## The Real Cost of Open Source ATS

"Free" does not mean zero cost. Open source eliminates licensing fees, but three other cost categories remain:

### 1. Infrastructure Cost

You need somewhere to run the software. Options range from $5/month to $50/month depending on scale:

| Hosting Option | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Shared VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean) | $5–$15 | Teams under 50 employees |
| Managed platform (Railway, Render) | $5–$20 | Teams without DevOps resources |
| AWS / GCP / Azure | $20–$50+ | Enterprise deployments with compliance requirements |
| On-premises server | $0 incremental (existing hardware) | Organizations with existing data center infrastructure |

### 2. Setup and Maintenance Time

Initial deployment takes 1–8 hours depending on the platform and your team's experience. Modern Docker-based ATS platforms like [Reqcore](/) deploy with `docker compose up` — PostgreSQL, MinIO, and the application start in minutes.

Ongoing maintenance averages 1–2 hours per month: applying updates, monitoring uptime, and running backups. On a managed platform, this drops to under 30 minutes per month.

### 3. Opportunity Cost

Time your team spends maintaining the ATS is time not spent on other projects. For a company where engineering hours cost $150/hour, 2 hours/month of maintenance equals $3,600/year. Compare that to $12,000–$36,000/year in SaaS subscription fees for a 10-person hiring team. According to [SHRM's benchmarking report](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/new-shrm-benchmark-report-cost-per-hire-averages-4129), the average cost-per-hire sits around $4,700 — SaaS ATS subscription fees consume a significant share of that HR budget before a single candidate is screened.

For a complete cost analysis with 3-year projections across different team sizes and hosting configurations, see our [total cost of ownership: SaaS ATS vs self-hosted](/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-saas-ats-vs-self-hosted) breakdown.

**The math is clear:** even after including infrastructure and maintenance, an open source ATS costs 60–90% less than a commercial SaaS ATS over three years. And unlike per-seat pricing, the cost does not scale with team size.

## Open Source ATS vs Proprietary ATS

This is the decision most hiring teams actually face. Here is an honest comparison:

| Dimension | Open Source ATS | Proprietary ATS (SaaS) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **License cost** | $0 | $50–$150/seat/month |
| **Source code access** | Full — read, modify, audit | None — proprietary, closed |
| **Data ownership** | You own and host everything | Vendor stores and controls data |
| **AI transparency** | Scoring logic visible and auditable | Hidden algorithms, unexplainable decisions |
| **Customization** | Unlimited — modify the source code | Limited to vendor's configuration options |
| **Vendor lock-in** | None — switch platforms or fork anytime | High — proprietary data formats, export limitations |
| **Support** | Community, documentation, optional paid support | Dedicated vendor support with SLAs |
| **Pre-built integrations** | API-first, fewer turnkey connectors | 50+ pre-built integrations (job boards, HRIS, calendars) |
| **Setup effort** | 1–8 hours (Docker deployment) | Minutes (sign up and start) |
| **Updates** | Manual — pull and deploy new versions | Automatic — vendor handles releases |

Neither model is universally better. The choice depends on your team's technical capacity, budget sensitivity, data sensitivity, and how much control you need over your hiring infrastructure.

## Examples of Open Source ATS Platforms

### Reqcore

**License:** MIT | **Stack:** Nuxt 4, PostgreSQL 16, Drizzle ORM, MinIO | **Deployment:** Docker Compose, Railway

Reqcore is the ATS we built after evaluating every open source and commercial option on the market. The core differentiators: zero per-seat pricing, full data ownership, and a modern TypeScript codebase. AI candidate ranking is on the roadmap and will expose its scoring logic visibly when it ships. Deploys in minutes with `docker compose up`. MIT-licensed, meaning you can modify and integrate without restriction.

**Best for:** Teams that value data ownership, open-source transparency, and a modern developer experience. [Try the live demo](/auth/sign-in) or see the [product roadmap](/roadmap).

### OpenCATS

**License:** MPL 2.0 | **Stack:** PHP 7, MySQL/MariaDB | **Deployment:** LAMP stack

The longest-running open source ATS, maintained since the late 2000s. Handles basic candidate tracking, resume storage, and job management. The interface reflects its age — menu-heavy, full page reloads, no drag-and-drop pipeline. No AI features, no API, and deployment requires manual LAMP configuration.

**Best for:** Agencies needing a free, functional system and comfortable with legacy PHP. The project is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS). For a complete comparison, see our [OpenCATS vs Reqcore](/blog/opencats-vs-reqcore) head-to-head.

### FreeATS

**License:** Open source | **Stack:** Varies | **Deployment:** Cloud-hosted with self-host option

A community-driven ATS focused on simplicity. Adapts to company needs through community feedback. Newer than OpenCATS with a more modern approach but a smaller ecosystem.

### SpotAxis (Assystant)

**License:** MIT | **Stack:** Python, Django | **Deployment:** Self-hosted

Published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Assystant/SpotAxis) by Assystant, SpotAxis targets teams wanting a streamlined open source ATS without enterprise complexity. MIT-licensed with a Django backend.

## How to Evaluate an Open Source ATS

Not all open source ATS platforms are production-ready. Before committing, audit the project against these criteria:

### The 7-Point Open Source ATS Evaluation Framework

| # | Criterion | What to Check | Red Flag |
|---|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | **License** | OSI-approved license (MIT, GPL, Apache, MPL) | Custom license, "source available" but not OSI-approved |
| 2 | **Active maintenance** | Commits in the last 6 months, responsive issue tracker | No commits for 12+ months, unanswered issues |
| 3 | **Documentation** | Installation guide, API docs, configuration reference | README-only, no deployment instructions |
| 4 | **Deployment story** | Docker support, clear prerequisites, environment variables | Manual multi-step install with undocumented dependencies |
| 5 | **Data portability** | Standard database (PostgreSQL, MySQL), CSV/API export | Proprietary data format, no export mechanism |
| 6 | **Security posture** | Dependency updates, vulnerability disclosure process, HTTPS by default | Outdated dependencies, no security policy |
| 7 | **Community** | Contributors (not just one person), discussions, roadmap | Single maintainer, no community engagement |

**Rule of thumb:** If a project fails on criteria 1, 2, or 5, do not use it for production hiring — regardless of how good the features look. An unmaintained ATS with a non-standard license and no data export path is a liability, not a tool.

## Data Ownership: The Hidden Advantage of Open Source ATS

The most underappreciated benefit of open source ATS is not cost savings — it is data ownership.

When you use a proprietary cloud ATS, your candidate database — every resume, interview note, pipeline decision, and communication — lives on the vendor's servers. If you cancel your subscription, data export is often partial. Custom fields, pipeline stages, and scorecards rarely survive migration. The vendor has no incentive to make leaving easy.

With a self-hosted open source ATS, your data lives in a standard database you control. A PostgreSQL `pg_dump` gives you a complete, portable backup. Switch to a different system tomorrow, and your data comes with you. We chose PostgreSQL 16 for Reqcore specifically because its JSON column support handles custom application form schemas, and `pg_dump` produces standards-compliant exports that work with any PostgreSQL-compatible tool — portability was non-negotiable from day one.

This matters more than most teams realize at the point of purchase. The average company uses an ATS for 3–5 years. Over that period, the candidate database becomes a strategic asset — a searchable talent pool for future roles, a record of hiring decisions for compliance, and a dataset for improving your recruitment process. Losing control of that asset because of a vendor relationship is an avoidable risk.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does ATS mean?

ATS stands for applicant tracking system. It is software that manages the recruitment process — from posting jobs to tracking candidates through interview stages to extending offers. Every company that hires regularly uses an ATS, whether it is purpose-built software, a spreadsheet, or an email inbox (the latter two are ATS in name only).

### Is there any good open source ATS available?

Yes. [Reqcore](/) is a modern, MIT-licensed open source ATS built on Nuxt 4 and PostgreSQL with transparent AI scoring. OpenCATS is the longest-running open source ATS, suitable for basic tracking needs. FreeATS and SpotAxis are additional options. See our [complete comparison](/blog/best-open-source-applicant-tracking-systems) for a ranked evaluation.

### Is an open source ATS secure enough for candidate data?

Open source software is not inherently less secure than proprietary software. In many cases, it is more secure — public code is auditable by anyone, and vulnerabilities are identified faster, a principle supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/). The security of your ATS depends on deployment practices: HTTPS enforcement, database access controls, dependency updates, and regular backups. Self-hosting an open source ATS on properly configured infrastructure gives you more security control than trusting a third-party vendor with your candidate PII.

### Can a non-technical team use an open source ATS?

Yes, with caveats. Modern open source ATS platforms deploy on managed platforms like Railway or Render with minimal technical knowledge — push to GitHub and the application deploys automatically. Day-to-day use of the ATS (posting jobs, managing candidates, scheduling interviews) requires no technical skills. Initial setup and occasional maintenance are the only phases that benefit from technical capacity, and managed platforms reduce even that to near-zero.

### How is an open source ATS different from a free ATS?

A free ATS gives you access to software at no cost, but the vendor controls the source code, your data, and the product roadmap. A free tier can be restricted or eliminated at any time. An open source ATS publishes its source code under a recognized license — you can run it, modify it, and keep using it forever, regardless of what happens to the original company or project. Open source is a legal guarantee of perpetual access; "free" is a pricing decision that can change.

## The Bottom Line

An open source applicant tracking system is recruitment software you can see inside, run on your own terms, and use without per-seat fees. It stores candidate data on infrastructure you control, lets you inspect and modify every line of code — including AI scoring logic — and eliminates vendor lock-in by design.

The trade-off is setup effort and self-managed infrastructure. For teams with technical capacity (or access to managed platforms like Railway), that trade-off yields 60–90% cost savings, full data ownership, and a hiring system that grows with your team without growing your software bill.

Whether it is the right choice depends on three things: your technical resources, your data sensitivity requirements, and how much you value owning your hiring infrastructure versus renting it. For most growing companies, the answer is increasingly clear.
