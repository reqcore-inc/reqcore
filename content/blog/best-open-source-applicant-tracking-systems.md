# Best Open Source Applicant Tracking Systems [2026]

Open source applicant tracking systems give you what no SaaS vendor will: the source code, the database, and the freedom to run your hiring infrastructure on your terms. After building [Reqcore](/) from scratch and evaluating every credible open source ATS on the market, we compiled this guide to help you pick the right one for your team.

This is not a list padded with "freemium" SaaS tools. Every platform here publishes its source code under a recognized open source license. You can inspect it, fork it, and deploy it on your own servers.

## Why Choose an Open Source ATS?

Before comparing individual platforms, it matters to understand why open source is worth considering at all. The three reasons recruiters and engineering teams consistently cite:

**Data ownership.** Your candidate database — names, resumes, interview notes, pipeline history — lives on infrastructure you control. No vendor can hold it hostage behind a subscription, and no surprise Terms of Service change can limit your access.

**No per-seat pricing.** Most commercial ATS platforms charge $50–$150 per recruiter per month. A 10-person hiring team costs $12,000–$18,000 per year before add-ons. According to [SHRM data](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition), the average cost-per-hire sits around $4,700, and recruiting software subscriptions take up a significant chunk of that HR budget. Open source eliminates that line item entirely.

**Transparency.** You can read the code that handles your candidates. If the system uses AI to rank applicants, you can inspect the scoring logic — a capability the [EU AI Act classifies as essential](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) for high-risk AI systems, which includes employment decisions. No black boxes, no opaque algorithms making decisions about people without explanation.

For a deeper analysis of these trade-offs, read our [self-hosted vs cloud ATS comparison](/blog/self-hosted-vs-cloud-ats).

## How We Evaluated Each Platform

We assessed every open source ATS on seven criteria that matter for production use — not just feature checklists:

| Criteria | What We Looked For |
|---|---|
| **License** | OSI-approved license (MIT, GPL, LGPL, MPL, Apache 2.0) |
| **Active maintenance** | Commits in the last 6 months, responsive issue tracker |
| **Deployment effort** | Docker support, documentation quality, time-to-first-job-posting |
| **Core ATS features** | Job management, candidate pipeline, resume storage, application forms |
| **Extensibility** | API availability, plugin architecture, custom field support |
| **Tech stack** | Modern vs legacy, database choice, self-hosting complexity |
| **Community & support** | Community size, documentation, commercial support options |

We did not score platforms on features they announce but haven't shipped.

## 1. Reqcore

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | MIT |
| **Tech stack** | Nuxt 4, PostgreSQL 16, Drizzle ORM, MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose, Railway, any VPS |
| **Status** | Active development |
| **Website** | [reqcore.com](https://reqcore.com) |

Reqcore is the ATS we built because the alternatives did not meet our requirements. We evaluated OpenCATS, tried bolting Odoo's recruitment module onto an existing ERP setup, and spent weeks testing commercial SaaS platforms. The conclusion was always the same: we wanted three things that no existing open source ATS delivered together — a modern tech stack, transparent AI scoring, and genuine zero-cost team scaling.

We chose PostgreSQL 16 over MySQL because we needed robust JSON column support for custom application form schemas, and we picked Drizzle ORM over Prisma because Drizzle generates zero runtime overhead — every query compiles to a plain SQL string at build time. For document storage, we used MinIO (S3-compatible) so resumes and cover letters stay on infrastructure you control, but the system works with any S3 provider including Railway Storage Buckets or AWS. These are not abstract architecture decisions. They determine whether your candidate data is portable or locked in.

**What sets it apart:**

- **Transparent AI (Glass Box principle).** When Reqcore ranks a candidate, it shows the matching logic — a visible summary of why a candidate scored the way they did. Recruiters can verify, override, and trust the results. This is the opposite of the "secret algorithm" approach used by Greenhouse, Lever, and every other commercial platform.
- **Zero per-seat pricing.** Your entire team accesses the system at no additional cost. Adding a hiring manager or a new recruiter does not increase your software bill.
- **Full data sovereignty.** Candidate data is stored in your PostgreSQL database. Resumes and documents go to MinIO (or any S3-compatible storage). You own the infrastructure. If you stop using Reqcore tomorrow, your data stays exactly where it is.
- **Modern stack.** Built on Nuxt 4 with server-side rendering, Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries, and Tailwind CSS for the UI. The codebase is readable and extensible — not a decade-old PHP monolith.

**Deployment:** Run `docker compose up` and you have PostgreSQL, MinIO, and the application running in minutes. Our `docker-compose.yml` weighs in at under 50 lines — no Kubernetes, no orchestration complexity. For managed hosting, deploy to Railway or Render with a GitHub push. Our production instance runs on a single Railway service at roughly $5/month.

**Limitations:** Reqcore is newer than established options like OpenCATS. Advanced features like resume parsing and AI candidate matching are shipping in phases — the [product roadmap](/roadmap) is public and transparent.

**Best for:** Teams that value data ownership, transparent AI, and a clean modern codebase. Developers and founders who want to self-host without wrestling with legacy PHP.

## 2. OpenCATS

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | MPL 2.0 / CPL 1.1a (Mozilla Public License / CATS Public License) |
| **Tech stack** | PHP 7, MySQL/MariaDB |
| **Deployment** | Manual LAMP stack, community Docker images |
| **Status** | Low activity (sporadic updates) |
| **Repository** | [github.com/opencats/OpenCATS](https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS) |

OpenCATS is the grandfather of open source applicant tracking. Originally released around 2007, it has been the default recommendation for anyone searching "open source ATS" for over a decade.

**Strengths:**

- **Battle-tested.** Thousands of companies have deployed OpenCATS. The core workflow — post jobs, collect applications, move candidates through a pipeline — works.
- **Simple requirements.** Runs on a standard LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). No complex container orchestration needed.
- **Resume parsing.** Supports basic resume-to-text extraction, which many open source ATS platforms lack entirely.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Aging codebase.** The PHP 7 architecture shows its years. The UI is functional but dated compared to modern web applications.
- **Maintenance concerns.** Development activity has been inconsistent. Issues and pull requests can sit unaddressed for months.
- **No Docker-first deployment.** Official Docker support does not exist. Community-maintained images vary in quality and freshness.
- **Limited API.** No RESTful API for integrations. Extending OpenCATS requires modifying PHP files directly.

**Best for:** Teams with PHP expertise who need a proven, simple ATS and are comfortable maintaining a legacy codebase.

---

## 3. CandidATS

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | GPL v3 / MPL 2.0 |
| **Tech stack** | PHP 7, MySQL/MariaDB |
| **Deployment** | Manual LAMP stack, Docker (community) |
| **Status** | Moderate activity |
| **Repository** | GitHub (community fork of OpenCATS) |

CandidATS is a community-driven fork of OpenCATS that addresses some of the original project's stagnation. It includes bug fixes, security patches, and modest UI improvements that the upstream project has not merged.

**Strengths:**

- **More responsive maintenance.** Bug fixes and security patches ship faster than in the original OpenCATS project.
- **Improved UI.** Minor but meaningful interface updates make daily use less painful.
- **Familiar foundation.** If you know OpenCATS, CandidATS is immediately usable. Same data model, same workflow, better maintained.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Same tech debt.** The underlying PHP 7 codebase and MySQL schema remain unchanged. This is an incremental improvement, not a rewrite.
- **Small community.** Fewer contributors than OpenCATS means less diverse feature development.
- **No modern API or integrations.** The same integration limitations as OpenCATS apply.

**Best for:** Current OpenCATS users who want better maintenance without migrating to a completely different platform.

## 4. OrangeHRM Community Edition

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | GPL v3 |
| **Tech stack** | PHP (Symfony), MySQL/MariaDB |
| **Deployment** | Manual, Docker (official), cloud hosting available |
| **Status** | Active (backed by OrangeHRM Inc.) |
| **Website** | [orangehrm.com](https://www.orangehrm.com) |

OrangeHRM is a full HR management suite, not a standalone ATS. The Community Edition is open source and includes a recruitment module alongside leave management, time tracking, employee records, and performance reviews.

**Strengths:**

- **Complete HR suite.** If you need more than just recruitment — time tracking, leave management, employee self-service — OrangeHRM handles the full employee lifecycle in one platform.
- **Commercial backing.** OrangeHRM Inc. actively develops the product. The community edition benefits from enterprise-grade improvements trickling down.
- **Docker support.** Official Docker images make deployment straightforward.
- **Large user base.** Over 5 million users globally provides a proven track record.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Recruitment is a module, not the focus.** The ATS functionality is adequate but not deep. No advanced pipeline customization, no AI scoring, limited automation.
- **Feature gating.** Many useful features (advanced reporting, recruitment analytics, API access) are reserved for the paid Advanced and Enterprise editions.
- **Heavyweight.** You install an entire HR suite when you may only need applicant tracking. The overhead is significant for teams that just want to manage a hiring pipeline.

**Best for:** Companies that need a full HRMS and want recruitment built into the same system. Not ideal if you need a focused, deep ATS.

## 5. Odoo Recruitment

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | LGPL v3 (Community Edition) |
| **Tech stack** | Python 3, PostgreSQL, JavaScript (Owl framework) |
| **Deployment** | Docker, manual, Odoo.sh (managed) |
| **Status** | Very active (backed by Odoo S.A.) |
| **Website** | [odoo.com](https://www.odoo.com) |

Odoo is an open source ERP with 80+ business modules, one of which is Recruitment. The Community Edition is LGPL-licensed, and the recruitment module is included.

**Strengths:**

- **Deep integration.** If your company already uses Odoo for accounting, CRM, or project management, adding recruitment creates a unified workflow with zero integration effort.
- **Kanban pipelines.** The recruitment module includes visual Kanban boards for candidate tracking — a feature many open source ATS lack.
- **Active ecosystem.** Thousands of community modules extend functionality. The developer community is one of the largest in open source business software.
- **Modern Python stack.** PostgreSQL as the database and Python 3 as the backend make the codebase approachable for most development teams.

**Weaknesses:**

- **ERP complexity.** Odoo is an enterprise resource planning system. Installing it to track 20 job applicants is like buying a cargo ship to cross a river.
- **Community vs Enterprise confusion.** Some recruitment features (like advanced reporting and multi-company support) require the Enterprise edition, which is not open source.
- **Learning curve.** The Odoo framework has its own conventions (OWL components, XML views, Python models). Customizing the recruitment module requires learning the Odoo way.
- **Resource-heavy.** Running Odoo requires more server resources than a lightweight dedicated ATS.

**Best for:** Companies already invested in the Odoo ecosystem who want recruitment as an integrated module.

## 6. ERPNext HRMS

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | GPL v3 |
| **Tech stack** | Python 3 (Frappe framework), MariaDB, Redis |
| **Deployment** | Docker (Frappe Docker), manual, Frappe Cloud (managed) |
| **Status** | Active (backed by Frappe Technologies) |
| **Website** | [erpnext.com](https://erpnext.com) |

ERPNext is an open source ERP built on the Frappe framework. The HRMS module includes recruitment functionality: job openings, applicant tracking, interview scheduling, and offer letters.

**Strengths:**

- **Full-cycle HR.** Recruitment flows directly into employee onboarding, payroll, and performance management. No data re-entry between systems.
- **Frappe framework.** The underlying framework is well-documented and genuinely developer-friendly. Custom fields, workflows, and reporting are configurable without code changes.
- **Self-hosted and managed options.** Frappe Cloud offers one-click deployment. Self-hosting with Docker is well-documented.
- **Active community.** Regular releases, active forum, and a growing contributor base.

**Weaknesses:**

- **ATS as afterthought.** The recruitment features are functional but shallow compared to dedicated ATS platforms. No advanced candidate scoring, limited automation.
- **Frappe learning curve.** Like Odoo, the Frappe framework has its own patterns. Building custom features requires learning Frappe-specific concepts (doctypes, hooks, jinja templates).
- **Heavy stack.** MariaDB + Redis + Node.js + Python + Nginx. The infrastructure requirements are significant for a recruitment tool.

**Best for:** Companies already using ERPNext who want basic recruitment integrated into their existing ERP.

---

## 7. Sentrifugo

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **License** | GPL v3 |
| **Tech stack** | PHP (Zend Framework), MySQL |
| **Deployment** | Manual LAMP stack |
| **Status** | Low activity |
| **Website** | [sentrifugo.com](https://www.sentrifugo.com) |

Sentrifugo is an open source HRM system that includes a recruitment module. It covers employee management, leave tracking, appraisals, and basic applicant tracking.

**Strengths:**

- **User-friendly interface.** Compared to OpenCATS, Sentrifugo's UI feels more polished and modern.
- **Role-based access control.** Granular permissions make it suitable for organizations with multiple departments and varying access levels.
- **Lightweight.** Less complex than Odoo or ERPNext for teams that need basic HR with recruitment.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Minimal recruitment depth.** The ATS features are basic: job postings, applications, candidate status tracking. No pipeline visualization, no resume parsing, no candidate scoring.
- **Stagnant development.** Updates have been infrequent. The Zend Framework base is aging.
- **No Docker support.** Manual LAMP deployment only.
- **Limited documentation.** Setup guides and API docs are sparse.

**Best for:** Small teams that want a lightweight, self-hosted HR tool with basic recruitment. Not for organizations with complex hiring needs.

## The Real Cost: Open Source ATS vs SaaS ATS

One of the most common questions about open source ATS platforms is "what does it actually cost?" The license is free, but infrastructure and maintenance are not zero.

Here is a realistic 3-year total cost comparison for a company with 10 recruiters:

| Cost Item | SaaS ATS (Mid-Tier) | Open Source ATS (Self-Hosted) |
|---|---|---|
| **Software license** | $100/seat/mo × 10 = $12,000/yr | $0 |
| **Infrastructure** | Included in subscription | ~$10–$20/mo VPS = $120–$240/yr |
| **Initial setup** | 2–4 hours | 4–16 hours (depending on platform) |
| **Setup cost** (at $150/hr engineering time) | $300–$600 | $600–$2,400 |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Included | ~2 hrs/month = $3,600/yr |
| **3-year total** | **$36,300–$36,600** | **$4,560–$10,920** |

Even at the high end — assuming senior engineering time for setup and monthly maintenance — the self-hosted open source option costs 70–87% less over three years. The savings multiply as you add team members, since SaaS pricing scales per seat while self-hosted costs remain flat.

For a deeper breakdown including hidden cost categories, per-seat compounding analysis, and a TCO calculator framework, see our [total cost of ownership: SaaS ATS vs self-hosted](/blog/total-cost-of-ownership-saas-ats-vs-self-hosted) guide.

The more honest framing: open source does not cost zero. It costs engineering time instead of subscription dollars. For companies with technical capacity, that trade-off is overwhelmingly favorable. For reference, Reqcore's production deployment on Railway costs roughly $5/month for the application service plus the included PostgreSQL database and S3 storage — that is $180 over three years for a fully managed platform, not $36,000.

For companies with zero technical staff, a managed deployment option (like Reqcore on Railway or ERPNext on Frappe Cloud) bridges the gap without requiring server administration skills.

## How to Evaluate an Open Source ATS: The 5-Question Framework

Before committing to any platform, answer these five questions:

### 1. Does your team have the technical capacity to self-host?

Running a web application requires someone who can manage a Linux server, configure DNS, set up TLS, and troubleshoot deployment issues. If the answer is "no one on our team can do this," look for platforms with managed hosting options (Reqcore on Railway, ERPNext on Frappe Cloud, Odoo on Odoo.sh).

### 2. Do you need a dedicated ATS or a recruitment module inside a larger system?

If recruitment is your only need, a focused ATS (Reqcore, OpenCATS) will serve you better than an ERP with a recruitment add-on (Odoo, ERPNext). ERP-based recruitment modules are adequate but shallow — they lack features like advanced pipeline management, candidate scoring, and custom application forms.

### 3. How important is data ownership to your organization?

If you handle sensitive candidate data, operate in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government), or simply want to own your talent database as a long-term asset, self-hosted open source is the strongest option. Your candidate data stays in your PostgreSQL database, backed up on your schedule, retained as long as you decide.

### 4. Will you need AI-assisted candidate ranking?

Most open source ATS platforms have no AI features. The commercial options that do (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby) use opaque algorithms you cannot inspect. Reqcore is building transparent AI scoring where the matching logic is visible and auditable — a feature we believe should be table stakes for any system making decisions about people.

### 5. What is your budget — in money and in engineering time?

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| $0 budget, has a developer | Self-hosted Reqcore or OpenCATS |
| $0 budget, no developer | Managed deployment (Reqcore on Railway) |
| $500–$2,000/yr budget | Self-hosted with occasional contractor support |
| $10,000+/yr budget, no developer | Consider SaaS — but question per-seat pricing |

---

## Open Source vs Free: They Are Not the Same Thing

Many "best free ATS" lists mix genuinely open source platforms with freemium SaaS tools that offer a limited free tier. The distinction matters:

**Open source** means the source code is publicly available under a license that grants you the right to use, modify, and distribute it — as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd). You can run it on your own infrastructure, fork it, and customize it without permission from anyone.

**Freemium** means a company offers a restricted version of their proprietary software at no cost — with feature limits, user caps, or data restrictions. The company controls the code, the infrastructure, and your data. They can change the terms, raise prices, or shut down the free tier at any time.

| | Open Source ATS | Freemium SaaS ATS |
|---|---|---|
| Source code access | ✅ Full access | ❌ Proprietary |
| Self-hosting option | ✅ Your infrastructure | ❌ Vendor-hosted only |
| Data ownership | ✅ Your database | ❌ Vendor's database |
| Customization | ✅ Unlimited | ❌ Limited to vendor's options |
| Price stability | ✅ License is permanent | ❌ Can change anytime |
| Feature limits | ❌ None (code is complete) | ✅ Gated by tier |

Tools like Recruitee, Breezy HR, and JazzHR offer free tiers but are not open source. If data ownership and long-term cost predictability matter to you, the distinction is critical.

---

## Deploying Your First Open Source ATS

For teams ready to get started, here is a general deployment path that applies to most platforms on this list:

1. **Choose your infrastructure.** A $10–$20/month VPS from Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or Linode is sufficient for most teams. For managed deployment, Railway and Render support Docker-based apps.

2. **Clone and configure.** Pull the repository, copy the example environment file, and set your database credentials, S3 storage keys, and application secrets.

3. **Start with Docker Compose.** If the platform supports it (Reqcore, OrangeHRM, Odoo, ERPNext), `docker compose up` handles the database, storage, and application in one command.

4. **Set up DNS and TLS.** Point your domain to the server. Use Caddy or Nginx with Let's Encrypt for automatic HTTPS.

5. **Post your first job.** Create an organization, configure your pipeline stages, and publish a job posting. The entire process should take under an hour for platforms with good documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best open source applicant tracking system in 2026?

The best open source ATS depends on your team's technical capacity and needs. For teams that want a modern, focused ATS with transparent AI and full data ownership, Reqcore is the strongest option. For teams already running Odoo or ERPNext, their built-in recruitment modules avoid adding another system. OpenCATS remains viable for teams comfortable with PHP.

### Is an open source ATS secure enough for candidate data?

Open source software is not inherently less secure than proprietary software. In fact, code transparency means security researchers and the community can identify and patch vulnerabilities faster — a principle validated by [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) and supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/). The key security factor is not the license — it is how you deploy and maintain the system. Keep your dependencies updated, use HTTPS, restrict database access, and follow standard server hardening practices.

### Can a small company without developers use an open source ATS?

Yes, through managed deployment options. Reqcore can be deployed on Railway with a GitHub push — no server management required. ERPNext offers Frappe Cloud. Odoo offers Odoo.sh. These managed platforms handle infrastructure while you retain the benefits of open source (data portability, no vendor lock-in).

### How does an open source ATS handle AI candidate scoring?

Most open source ATS platforms do not include AI features yet. Reqcore is actively building transparent AI scoring where every ranking decision comes with a visible Matching Logic summary. This is fundamentally different from commercial ATS platforms that use opaque algorithms — you can see exactly why a candidate was scored the way they were.

### How do I migrate from a cloud ATS to an open source ATS?

Export your candidates, jobs, and application data from your current platform (most offer CSV exports). Deploy the open source ATS, then import the data via the API or a database migration script. Verify the imported data by spot-checking records and running a test hiring workflow. The entire process typically takes 1–2 days for a small-to-medium team.

---

## The Bottom Line

The open source ATS market in 2026 splits into two categories: legacy PHP systems (OpenCATS, CandidATS, Sentrifugo) that work but show their age, and recruitment modules bolted onto larger ERP/HR platforms (Odoo, ERPNext, OrangeHRM) that trade depth for breadth.

Reqcore exists because neither category satisfied what we needed: a modern, focused applicant tracking system built for data ownership and transparent AI — without the per-seat tax that punishes growing teams. We built it, we use it, and we open-sourced it under the MIT license because we believe hiring infrastructure should be owned, not rented.

Our honest recommendation: if you already run Odoo or ERPNext, use their recruitment modules and skip the overhead of a separate system. If you need a dedicated ATS and have a developer on the team, try Reqcore — deploy it in 10 minutes with Docker Compose and decide for yourself. If you want the fastest path with zero infrastructure, deploy Reqcore on Railway and you will be posting your first job within the hour.

Stop paying rent on your candidate database. The data is yours.
