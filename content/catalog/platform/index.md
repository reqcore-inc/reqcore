title: Platform & Infrastructure
description: "The foundation layer — multi-tenant organizations, authentication, dashboard, deployment, and the tech stack that powers everything."

Platform features are the invisible infrastructure that makes everything else work. Multi-tenant organizations isolate data between companies, Better Auth handles authentication with zero vendor lock-in, and the Docker Compose stack lets you deploy the entire system with a single command.

Reqcore runs on your infrastructure — whether that's a $5/month VPS, a corporate Kubernetes cluster, or Docker Desktop on your laptop.
