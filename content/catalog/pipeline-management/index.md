Pipeline Management is the core of any ATS. Reqcore gives you a visual, drag-and-drop Kanban board for every job, status-based workflows with enforced transitions, and a unified applications view across all jobs.

Unlike legacy systems that bury candidates in spreadsheets, Reqcore's pipeline is designed for recruiters who need to answer "what do I do next?" within three seconds.
