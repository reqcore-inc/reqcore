Use Applirank comfortably on mobile devices with layouts optimized for smaller screens and touch interactions.

## What it solves

Recruiters and hiring managers often need quick updates while commuting, between interviews, or during standups. Desktop-only layouts make this painful, causing missed updates and delayed hiring decisions.

## Planned implementation

- Responsive dashboard cards and tables with mobile-first breakpoints
- Touch-friendly pipeline stage controls for faster status updates
- Condensed candidate and application views for quick triage
- Sticky action bar for common actions (move stage, open profile, add note)
- Performance optimizations for lower-powered devices and slower mobile networks
