Reqcore's AI features follow the **Glass Box** principle: every AI decision must be explainable and auditable. When the system ranks a candidate, it shows you exactly which skills matched, why the score was assigned, and what data drove the recommendation.

This is not just a design preference — the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) classifies employment decisions as high-risk AI, meaning opaque ranking algorithms create real legal liability. Reqcore eliminates that risk by making AI reasoning fully visible.
