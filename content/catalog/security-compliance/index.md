Security in an ATS isn't optional — you're handling people's personal data, resumes, and employment history. Reqcore ships with production-ready security defaults: API rate limiting, comprehensive security headers, server-proxied document access, and input validation on every endpoint.

Every security feature is on by default. You don't have to remember to enable it.
