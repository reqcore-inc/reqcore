Recruitment Tools are the outward-facing surface of your ATS. They're what candidates see and interact with. Reqcore provides a public job board with SEO-optimized pages, customizable application forms with nine field types, and secure document management backed by S3-compatible storage.

Every tool is designed to work without requiring candidates to create an account — reducing friction and increasing application completion rates.
