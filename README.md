---

A flood of applicants turns hiring into a full-time scroll. Reqcore takes every application on a role, runs it through an AI shortlist, and shows you exactly why each candidate was ranked the way they were — no black box. No per-seat fees, unlimited applicants on every plan.

Reqcore is open-core: the full hiring workflow — jobs, pipeline, applications, documents, job board, and AI shortlisting — is AGPLv3 and lives in this repo. A small set of paid, cloud-only features (SSO/SAML, audit log, source analytics) live under [`ee/`](ee) on a separate commercial license. The core scoring and shortlist logic never depends on `ee/` — that's the part self-hosters and evaluators need to be able to trust and verify.

> The fastest way to use Reqcore is the hosted product at [reqcore.com](https://reqcore.com) — free until your first shortlist, no card required. Prefer to run it yourself? See [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting) below.

## Features

- **AI shortlisting** — Every application gets scored against the job with a visible breakdown of why, not a black-box rank
- **Resume parsing** — Structured data (contact, experience, education, skills) extracted from uploaded resumes automatically
- **Job management** — Create, edit, and track jobs through draft → open → closed → archived
- **Candidate pipeline** — Drag candidates through screening → interview → offer → hired with a Kanban board
- **Public job board** — SEO-friendly job listings with custom slugs that applicants can browse and apply to
- **Custom application forms** — Add custom questions (text, select, file upload, etc.) per job
- **Document storage** — Upload and manage resumes and cover letters via S3-compatible storage (MinIO)
- **Multi-tenant organizations** — Isolated data per organization with role-based membership
- **Recruiter dashboard** — At-a-glance stats, pipeline breakdown, recent applications, and top active jobs
- **GDPR tooling** — Candidate data retention windows, export, and erasure built in
- **Secure document access** — Resumes are never exposed via public URLs; all access is authenticated and streamed
- **Built-in rate limiting** — Protection against abuse on all endpoints out of the box

## Pricing

Reqcore is free to start and priced per active role, not per seat — invite your whole team without increasing the bill.

| Plan | Price | Active roles | Highlights |
|------|-------|:---:|------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 | Unlimited applicants, one AI shortlist to try it, bring your own AI key |
| **Solo** | $79/mo | 2 | Unlimited AI shortlists, bring your own AI key, full shortlist workflow |
| **Team** | $239/mo | 8 | Bring your own AI key, deeper per-application analysis, custom domain, integrations |
| **Scale** | $599/mo | 24 | SSO/SAML/SCIM, audit log, DPA/SLA |
| **Agency** | Contact us | Unlimited | Custom contract |

See the live [pricing page](https://reqcore.com/pricing) for full details. Self-hosted instances use the same plan gates — see [Licensing & self-hosting](#licensing--self-hosting).

## Self-Hosting

Reqcore can be run on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose. This is a best-effort, DIY path without support or an SLA — Reqcore's own support and uptime commitments apply only to the hosted product at [reqcore.com](https://reqcore.com).

```bash
mkdir reqcore && cd reqcore
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/main/docker-compose.production.yml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and sign up.

Code under [`ee/`](ee) gates itself behind the same plan checks as the hosted product, so it stays locked without your own billing configured — no separate license-key server needed.

Full setup instructions (building from source, updating, troubleshooting, managing your instance) live in **[SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md)**.

## Deployment

The hosted product runs on managed infrastructure. A typical self-hosted production deployment uses:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **VPS or container host** | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM recommended as a starting point |
| **Caddy** | Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS |
| **Cloudflare** | DNS, DDoS protection, edge SSL (free tier) |
| **Docker Compose** | Postgres + MinIO (localhost only) |
| **systemd** | Process management with auto-restart |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full deployment architecture diagram.
