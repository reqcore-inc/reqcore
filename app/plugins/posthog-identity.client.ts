/**
 * Client-only plugin that identifies the current user and organization

 * - Applies stored consent from localStorage BEFORE any identity events fire,
 *   preventing the race condition where identify() is discarded because PostHog
 *   is still in opt_out_capturing_by_default mode when ConsentBanner hasn't
 *   mounted yet.
 * - Calls posthog.identify() with the user's ID and safe properties
 * - Calls posthog.group() for the active organization (group analytics)
 * - Resets PostHog on sign-out to avoid cross-user data leakage
